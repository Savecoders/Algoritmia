// stric mode is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of JavaScript

// 1. Strict mode eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.
// 2. Strict mode fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that's not strict mode.
// 3. Strict mode prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.

// Strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or function.

"use strict";
